# Profile Image

Place your profile image in this directory with the name `default-profile.png`.

This image will be used as your profile picture in the portfolio and will be included in the Vercel deployment.

## Steps to add your profile image:

1. Rename your profile image to `default-profile.png`
2. Place it in this directory (`public/images/profile/`)
3. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
4. Vercel will automatically deploy the updated image

This ensures your profile image is always available, even when deployed to Vercel.
