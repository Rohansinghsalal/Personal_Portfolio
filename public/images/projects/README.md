# Project Images

Place your project screenshots and images in this directory.

These images will be used in your Projects section and will be included in the Vercel deployment.

## Steps to add your project images:

1. Name your project images descriptively (e.g., `project1.jpg`, `todo-app.png`, etc.)
2. Place them in this directory (`public/images/projects/`)
3. Reference them in your Projects component using paths like `/images/projects/project1.jpg`
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
5. Vercel will automatically deploy the updated images

This ensures your project images are always available, even when deployed to Vercel.
